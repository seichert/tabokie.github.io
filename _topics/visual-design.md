## Readability

### Contrast

In theory, readability correlates with the contrast between text and background.

Color contrast is measured by contrast ratio. Calculate the contrast ratio between two colors [here](https://contrast-ratio.com/). Contrast ratio between white and black is 21.

A minimum contrast ratio of 4.5 is [required](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) by WCAG.

I personally find anything less than 16 is eye-tiring, partly thanks to the outdated monitor I'm using.

Apart from color, font weight plays a role in perceived contrast as well.

### Dark Theme

In acedamia, dark theme is referred to as "negative polarity". And according to [this 2013 research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2013.790485), it is less readable than light theme.

### Line Break
