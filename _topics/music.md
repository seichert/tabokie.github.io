## Music Theory

Why does a melody sounds good? And what can we learn to compose more?

### Essential Concepts

- Note: Sound, in specific standardized sound that can be procedurally generated from a base frequency. It's the alphabet of music, used by musicians to share and reproduce melodies.
- Interval: Distance in pitch/frequency between two notes. **Just like human ears, we measures pitch distances in logarithmic fashion**, e.g. `distance(220Hz, 440Hz) == distance(440Hz, 880Hz)`.
- Scale: An ordered list of notes. Much like a number series, a scale is essential a base note and an interval pattern for subsequent notes. Scales with the same pattern sounds similar even with different base notes, and they are often named as one family, e.g. C major scale in major scale family.
- Perfect Interval: Two notes with perfect interval sounds most consonant/harmonious together. Because **harmony comes from alignment in waveforms**, `(nHz, knHz) where k >= 1` are considered the most perfect.
- Octave: The range of sounds between a base note and one with doubled frequency. It's the `log2` logarithmic grid for frequency. Base 2 is chosen because `(nHz, 2nHz)` are the closest two difference notes that sounds incredibly hamonious.
- Temperament: Procedural method to subdivide an octave (grid) into notes. Since 18th century, western music employs twelve-tone equal temperament, which equally divides an octave into 12 notes, i.e. `Note(n) = sqrt[n/12](2) * Note(0)`.
> Before the mathematical tool to deal with irrational number was in place, people sought to deduce notes base on the next most hamonious sound, `3n/2Hz`. In those systems, intervals between notes aren't equal, and therefore it's often impossible to variate a melody by changing the base note of its scale (because the physical interval pattern is changed and the melody sounds off).  See [Pythagorean tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning) or [十二律](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%8D%81%E4%BA%8C%E5%BE%8B) for more details.
