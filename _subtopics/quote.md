The evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

In nomine Patri, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

Sex has no value, because it lives and dies at present. Love is dangerous, because it looks to the future.

Makeup isn't about looking handsome, it's about begin anew.

I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.

我觉得每个人最艰难的时段之一就是在他二十来岁的时候，因为二十来岁的你总在声嘶力竭地表达自己，但其实你只理解一半的自己。随着年龄的增长，你就会悄悄的表达自己，但人们却围拢过来听你说。这个时候，你理解了一半再加上四分之一的自己。我觉得可悲的是，当你终于让所有人都围着你的时候，你却没有什么要表达的了。
