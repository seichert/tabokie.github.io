## Recurring lines from movies

The evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. ([Sworn testimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sworn_testimony))

In nomine Patri, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. (Latin prayer)

## Bravest Warrior (TV)

I'm Cat Bug!

It's bunker!

Temporal Pair-o-sox

## New Pope (TV)

Sex has no value, because it lives and dies at present. Love is dangerous, because it looks to the future.

Makeup isn't about looking handsome, it's about begin anew.

## The Bell Jar (Book) - Sylvia Plath

I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.

## Six Feet Under

Future is just a fucking concept we use to avoid being alive today

## Bill and Ted

Be excellent to each other.

Party on, dudes.
