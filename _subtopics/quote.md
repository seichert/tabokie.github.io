The evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

<p align="right">-- Sworn testimony</p>

In nomine Patri, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

<p align="right">-- Latin prayer</p>

Oh BMO, you tried, but you were never the hero of the story I like to call life.

<p align="right">-- "Adventure Time: Distant Lands" (Cartoon)</p>

I'm Cat Bug!

It's bunker!

Temporal Pair-o-sox

<p align="right">-- "Bravest Warrior" (Cartoon)</p>

In civilizations without boats, dreams dry up, espionage takes the place of adventure and the police take the place of pirates.

<p align="right">-- Michel Foucault</p>

Sex has no value, because it lives and dies at present. Love is dangerous, because it looks to the future.

Makeup isn't about looking handsome, it's about begin anew.

<p align="right">-- "New Pope" (TV Show)</p>

I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.

<p align="right">-- Sylvia Plath, "The Bell Jar" (Book)</p>

Future is just a fucking concept we use to avoid being alive today

<p align="right">-- "Six Feet Under" (TV Show)</p>

Be excellent to each other.

Party on, dudes.

<p align="right">-- "Bill and Ted" (Movie)</p>

我觉得每个人最艰难的时段之一就是在他二十来岁的时候，因为二十来岁的你总在声嘶力竭地表达自己，但其实你只理解一半的自己。随着年龄的增长，你就会悄悄的表达自己，但人们却围拢过来听你说。这个时候，你理解了一半再加上四分之一的自己。我觉得可悲的是，当你终于让所有人都围着你的时候，你却没有什么要表达的了。

<p align="right">-- Guillermo del Toro, 《吉尔莫·德尔·托罗的奇思妙想》</p>

Just have to make plans, that's the key, you just have to make plans, so that life has the illusion of meaning and forward momentum. And that's why you're here, so you've done something tonight. Because people tomorrow will ask you, "What did you do last night?" And then you can say, "I went to a live taping at the BBC cos I live in London. I'm alive, I'm alive."

We need to feel, as human beings, otherwise we will just consume and consume until there is nothing left.

<p align="right">-- Simon Amstell, "Numb" (Talk Show)</p>

在某种程度上，人类的艺术创作不再需要让人们告诉他们说，他们应该做什么。他们可能需要被告知，他们会得到报酬，但这不同于告诉他们应该做什么。

对某个痕迹的沉思静赏；一幅画，听到音乐，看到一个优雅的姿态，这都可能让精神激昂起来。这些是生活更美好、运行更充分的痕迹。我们喜欢它们、珍惜它们，因为我们也想如此生活，而他们激励了生活。这就是一件“艺术品”的价值。这些痕迹是不可避免的。生活在物中显现。

你最终能成功表达的只能是你实际已经设想到的东西。

思考一种没有动机的技法是毫无乐趣的。

<p align="right">-- Robert Henry, 《艺术精神》</p>

As there is no knowing in advance where a research enterprise may lead and what kind of skills it will require as it unfolds, this process of ‘equipping oneself’ has no predeterminable limits and is bad psychological policy….The great incentive to learning a new skill or supporting discipline is needing to use it.

Too much book learning may crab and confine the imagination, and endless poring over the research of others is sometimes psychologically a research substitute, much as reading romantic fiction may be a substitute for real-life romance….The beginner must read, but intently and choosily and not too much.

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.
