## Use incremental, descriptive command for self management.

## Track progress and manage weekly TODOs with Github Project.

- At most one major project per week
- Each project must have precise deadline
- New projects are put to cooling pool for at least a week before getting enrolled.

## Set daily time budget for untracked activities.

I uses Apple's `Shortcuts` app to time events (persistently store intermediate state to document) and record them to `Health` app's `mindful` minutes (which is useless to me), so that daily statistics can be summarized.

## Keep a worklog.

Well, worklog is used to log daily work. Some people keep track of every event and its begining/ending time. It has certain benifits such as allowing you to breakdown and analyze daily workload. But since I already use `ManicTime` to monitor PC usage, my worklog has become more of a semi-structured notebook. I frequently use tags to make it easier for later reorganizaztion.

BTW, I name my worklog "Log Lady" in memory of the lovely character from Twin Peaks.

## Always open two browsers, one for work, one for private life.
