{% include folder title='Reclaim disk space (on a shared server)' %}

1. delete some files

2. use `sudo lsof +L1` to kill process referencing those files

3. use `tune2fs -m <root-reserved-percentage> <device>` to grab more space from root

{% include folder title='C supports Variable Length Array (VLA)' %}

```c
void initialize(size_t n, size_t m, double A[n][m]);
```

{% include folder title='Forward Declaration' %}

Pros: hide implementations (declare `XXImpl`), circular dependence, faster compilation

Cons: can't use alias, potential inheritance is elided, delete an incomplete class is UB

{% include folder title='Evaluation Interleaving' %}

`f(std::shared_ptr(new A()), g())` is risky if `g()` can be interleaved between object allocation and `shared_ptr` initialization.

This is explicitly prohibited after C++17 ([StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38501587/what-are-the-evaluation-order-guarantees-introduced-by-c17/46472497#46472497))

I have a process table and I want to grep it for the phrase "banana":

```
ps auxww | grep banana

root 87 Jun21 0:26.78 /System/Library/CoreServices/FruitProcessor --core=banana

mikec 456 450PM 0:00.00 grep banana
```

Argh! It also greps for the grep for banana! Annoying!

Well, I'm sure there's pgrep or some clever thing, but my coworker showed me this and it took me a few minutes to realize how it works:

```
ps auxww | grep [b]anana

root 87 Jun21 0:26.78 /System/Library/CoreServices/FruitProcessor --core=banana
```

Doc Brown spoke to me: "You're just not thinking fourth dimensionally!" Like Marty, I have a real problem with that. But don't you see: [b]anana matches banana but it doesn't match 'grep [b]anana' as a raw string. And so I get only the process I wanted!
