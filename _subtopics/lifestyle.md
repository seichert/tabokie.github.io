On the format: It is an imitation of "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" by Wittgenstein, which preserves the logic between statements without an essay-ish form difficult for later amendments.

## 1 Efficiency

**1.1 Know exactly when to work and what to work on**

1.11 Treat fragmented work that involves large amount of time and produces less obvious results as habit

1.111 Habits involve minimum decision

1.1111 New tasks can be stacked on old habits to reuse the same circuit

1.1112 Habits can be associated with a new environment

1.11121 e.g. Walk to balcony to learn French

1.1113 Habits can be associatd with specific time point

1.12 Treat work that requires quality thinking as project

1.121 Man has limited bandwidth / concentration / production capability

1.1211 Work on one area for at least a month

1.1212 Work on one project for at least a week

1.122 [TODO] Prioritize tasks

1.1221 Important over urgent

1.1222 Balance between immediate desire and long term plan

1.123 Be specific

**1.2 Make it easy to start working**

1.21 Understand "planning" is not "working"

1.211 Planning offers illution of progress, without the possibility of failure

1.212 Perfect plan does not exist and even more so if you never enforce it

1.213 [Analysis paralysis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis)

1.22 Environment indicates behaviour

1.221 Forbid yourself from doing unrelated things

1.222 Surround yourself with related things

1.2221 One space for one thing, both physical and cyber spaces

1.23 Begin flexible: calibrate the workload

1.231 Anxiety hurts efficiency, a task composed of several smaller tasks has multipled difficulty

1.2311 Identify the bottleneck of current task, and reschedule the task

1.23111 e.g. Writing a French blog post is the composite of French writing and essay writing

1.2312 Identify the attractive part of current task, and reduce the unattractive parts

1.232 Choose frequency over intensity

1.24 Begin small: take the first step

1.241 Set a 15 minute count down where you must do the work

1.2411 Quote Scott Adams on procrastination: you are lying down and should get up but don't want to--start by moving just one finger, then your hand, etc.

1.25 Economical procrastination

1.251 Keep busy if you really need to stall

1.2511 Reading, which is rarely related to what I’m writing, or hoping to write, helps get started writing ([Susan Sontag Paris Review](https://fs.blog/2013/05/susan-sontag-how-i-write/))

1.2512 Do the next task in queue

**1.3 Find pleasure in even the dullest work**

1.31 Focus on process more than key results

1.311 Deadline set up just to improve efficiency is vulnerable

1.3111 Failure to deliver results on time lead to frustration

1.3112 See `1.32` to materialize a deadline by involving other people

1.312 The doing of something related to a specific objective helps estabilish a virtual character

1.3121 Repeated, predictable behaviours become proof for your identity

1.313 Concrete the work into benifits of process, rather than a pale TODO item

1.32 Gemification

1.321 Role-playing a character related to the area you are working on, resonating with `1.312`

1.3211 Decorate your life with things that are not necessarily helpful to productivity but build up an image

1.322 Ritualize the starting or finishing of working

1.323 Give yourself a treat when working hours reach certain milestone

1.3231 Doing this while adhering to `1.31`, the calculation of working hours should be irrelevant to actual progress

1.32311 Quote Goodhart's law: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

1.324 Streak, work in hand with `1.323`

1.3241 Never miss it twice

1.325 Involves other people to play

1.3251 e.g. make a bet, set a deadline

1.421 information should be arranged in a priority aligned with work

1.4211 Urgent over important
