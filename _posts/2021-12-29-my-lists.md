<!-- This is my first time doing a yearly summary of sorts, mostly inspired by [Fogus's post](http://blog.fogus.me/2021/12/27/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2021/). I try to make it less opinionated, because in principle, I detest the idea of sentiments on demand. -->

I'm a hoarder, so I collect. These are my beloved items of the year.

## Favorite Quotes

- **"The truth is, most of us discover where we are headed when we arrive."**
  <br />- Bill Watterson, "Some Thoughts on The Real World by One Who Glimpsed It And Fled" (1990 talk)
- **"Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. [...] The insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or sinful, it’s that they’re unconscious. They are default settings."**
  <br />- David Foster Wallace, "This is Water" (2005 talk)
- **"Don't you age yourself up again."**
  <br />- Wanda, "WandaVision" (2021 TV show)
- **"Oh BMO, you tried, but you were never the hero of the story I like to call life."**
  <br />- Football, "Adventure Time: Distant Lands" (2020 TV show)
- **"Self-reflection is a vice, best conducted in private, or not at all."**
  <br />- Roebuck Wright, "The French Dispatch" (2021 film)
- **"I'm painting my balls with the brush of indifference."**
  <br />- Adam Sharp, "The Correct Order of Biscuits" (2020 book)

## Impactful Thoughts

**1. Analog and digital as personality traits**

I learned about this from a podcast ["不可理论"](https://www.bukelilun.com/). The original phrasing can be found in Alexander Galloway's post [How to Spot an Analog Philosopher](http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/how-to-spot-an-analog-philosopher).

Trait can be confining if taken too seriously. But personally, I found identifying myself as an analog thinker helped me make some good lifestyle/aesthetic choices.

**2. Words shape reality**

This is a silly observation that I benefit a lot from. Compared to other senses, words form a most conceptual yet often overlooked reality. It functions through daily communication and inner voices, and secretly influenced our perception of the world.

More on this, Stanley Kubrick once [complained](https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/movies/odyssey-of-stanley-kubrick-part-3-toward-the-infinite-2001-michel-ciment/#:~:text=Kubrick%20has%20pointed%20out%20that%20the%20average%20viewer%20is%20oriented%20more%20to%20words%20than%20to%20images) about how the average audience are oriented more to words than to images. And here is an excerpt from "How to win a beauty contest" (1960) by Jacque Mercer:

> Your stage presentation in a beauty contest is exactly like a role in a play. You must have stage movements, you must have characterisation and you even need to learn some lines. The difference is that in a beauty contest the lines are not spoken out loud. **If you think these words and phrases in your mind, however, the expression on your face will tell a story.**

**3. Curse of knowledge**

I touched on this in my [previous post](/non-fiction/2021/12/06/lessons.html), that learning can often become an excuse for not doing. More importantly, the possession of knowledge undermines our belief in doing things with our own hands. Even when we manage to embark on an effort, the results rarely satisfy us, due to the mismatch between skill and taste.


## Other Thoughts New to Me

**1. Wright's Law and other rules**

The law is simple: production costs decreased at a 10%\~15% rate for every doubling of production numbers. It was first brought up to model the airplane, and recently(?) found its place in computer hardware industry. In specific, some [predict](https://blocksandfiles.com/2021/01/25/wikibon-ssds-vs-hard-drives-wrights-law/) that SSD will become cheaper than HDD by the year of 2026. Bryan Cantrill, at the first p99con, [talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuvp-e4ztC0) about the price of transistor and how that facilitates edge computing. (BTW, I just love the look of his new company [Oxide](https://oxide.computer/))

And there are other rules: the 5 Minute Rule ([1987](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/38713.38755), [1997](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/271074.271094), [2007](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1363189.1363198)), Latency Lags Bandwidth ([2004](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1022594.1022596)).

**2. Mind-Body Synergy**

This is an interesting field of research that I'm only recently aware of. It basically focuses on how mind controls the body in strange ways. I'm not an expert so I'll just paste some publications here.

- Glucose metabolism responds to perceived sugar intake more than actual sugar intake, 2020
- Remembering immunity: Neuronal ensembles in the insular cortex encode and retrieve specific immune responses, 2020
- Blood sugar level follows perceived time rather than actual time in people with type 2 diabetes, 2016
- The power of the mind: the cortex as a critical determinant of muscle strength/weakness, 2014
- The vagus nerve and the inflammatory reflex—linking immunity and metabolism, 2012

**3. Inline more**

Read [John Carmack on Inlined Code](http://number-none.com/blow/blog/programming/2014/09/26/carmack-on-inlined-code.html). I'm completely sold and have been rooting for it in my daily work.

**4. [Outsourcing leads us astray](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/how-tech-loses-out/)**

**5. [8 Bit & 8 Bitish Graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcJ1Jvtef0)**

## Favorite films

This year I watched 293 films+shows. I can see a big decline in amount and quality compared to last year.

Four people stood out in my memory:

- **Christian Petzold**: I was first introduced by his latest work **"Undine" (2020)**. He astounds me with the ability to convey large amount of subtexts underneath a minimalist look. **"Transit" (2018)**, among his earlier works, is also one of my 2021 favorites.
- **Céline Sciamma**: I watched her two films on childhood during this year's BJIFF: **"Tomboy" (2011)** and **"Petite Maman" (2021)**. Both of them awakened my long lost pleasure from interpreting the day-to-day human interactions, and earned my solid recommendation.
- **Oscar Isaac**: You should be familar with his appearance in "Dune" as "the Duke" by now. Out of pure coincidence, I also watched two of his prior films: **"A Most Violent Year" (2014, J.C. Chandor)** and **"The Card Counter" (2021, Paul Schrader)**. I wouldn't say the films themselves are that impressive, but his roles in them definitely stroke hard on me.
- **Wes Anderson**: I finished all of his films this year, and just love the wistful nostalgia. **"Rushmore" (1998)** and **"The Royal Tenenbaums" (2001)** are my favorites.

Other memorable films:

- **Collateral (1981)**, **Thief (2004)** by Michael Mann: What can I say, I'm a sucker for neo-noir. Also, do check out **King of New York (1990, Abel Ferrara)** if you haven't yet, it is my favorite neo-noir in recent memory.
- **The Guest (2014)** by Adam Wingard: Its third scene is both aesthetically pleasing and emotionally powerful. Considering the cliche genre it sets itself in, I am genially impressed by the otherworldly tone of the end result.

and TV shows:

- **Firefly (2002)** by Joss Whedon: Dive right in if you are a Cowboy Bebop fan.
- **Daredevil Season 3 (2018)**: This season truly builds up the character of Matt Murdock, making itself the best superhero adaptation of recent years. AND, this is the first time I've ever seen a Surface Book on screen. (Goto [Starring the Computer](http://www.starringthecomputer.com/computers.html) for more of these anecdotes)


## Favorite Books

This year I finished 54 books. These ones cultivated new passions of me:

- **Two Cheers for Anarchism (六论自发性)** by James C. Scott: Anarchism
- **世界大笨蛋反叛手册** by 松本哉: Anarchism
- **Underground - A Human History of the Worlds beneath Our Feet (地下世界)** by Will Hunt: Cave exploration

These are my other favorites:

- **Crime and Punishment (罪与罚)** by Fyodor Dostoevsky
- **Purple and Black (紫与黑)** by K.J. Parker: Sci-fi shorts.
- **Chronicle of a Death Foretold (一桩事先张扬的凶杀案)** by Gabriel García: How he manages to manipulate time is mind-bending.
- **疾风迅雷** by 杉浦康平: This book reminds me of the good old days when people still look forward to the monthly arrival of a printed magazine.
- **On Being a Photographer (摄影师手册)** by David Hurn: Harsh truth coming from a veteran creator.
- **Journal d’un écrivain en pyjama (穿睡衣的作家)** by Dany Laferrière: Similar work from a seasoned writer, except it's much wittier.
- **梦晕** by 藤本理

## Things I Tried

- **Translation**: Translated (from EN to CN) two short essays and one long essay (WIP). This work is too dull for me.
- **French**: Two years since I started. I don't have enough motivation to push it forward.
- **Photography theory**: I bought a dozen of books on this topic (literally) and read them all (almost). Needs a thorough reread to summarize my findings.
- **Drumset**: I learned for probably 20+ hours. My skill is still rusty, but I enjoyed it.
- **Music production**: Finished 9 out of 33 lessons in [Syntorial](https://www.syntorial.com/). [Learned music theory](/topics/music.html) for a few days.
- **Urban exploration**: I visited a new sight in April this year.
- **Body building**: Worked on simple excercises like weighted push-up and pull-up. Ate a lot of protein powders.
- **Game design**: Working on a new game. The initial plan is a neo-noir side scroller.
- **Zettelkasten**: Started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (after abandoning [RemNote](https://www.remnote.com/)) late this year.
- **Pixel Art**: Just started learning pixel art drawing. Drew 3 paintings in total. It's fairly easy to have good results with this medium.

## Plans for 2022

I don't like making plans. But I do have a few wishes for the future me:

- Learn more about climbing and cave exploration.
- Refurnish your love of films, start by finishing all the blu-rays you bought this year. Maybe do a few mashups or trailer recuts.
- Persist in taking notes of your readings, and regularly post out your learnings.
- Make progress on the game project.

Now, I've prepared a few more quotes for the new year, and bon voyage everyone~

> **When we sit down each day and do our work, power concentrates around us. The Muse takes note of our dedication. She approves. We have earned favor in her sight. When we sit down and work, we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come. Insights accrete.**
>
> -- Steven Pressfield, "War of Art"

> **The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.**
>
> -- Theodore Roosevelt
