I'm Xinye Tao, aka Tabokie\*.

I code for a living, specialized in System and Graphics, currently employed at [PingCAP](https://en.pingcap.com).

I'm a lifetime learner. This site exists to accompany me through the journey ahead.

I use different languages for writing, please feel free to contact me for possible translation.
