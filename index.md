Hi and welcome, I'm Xinye Tao.

I program for large-scale data systems. I'm drawn to their physicality -- the hardware as flesh and data as blood.

I love many other things. That includes music, photography and writing.

I believe in a future where work is not a mean to an end, but simply an “action”, as Hannah Arendt put it.


You can reach me at [xy.tao@outlook.com](mailto:xy.tao@outlook.com). I'm also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tabokie), [Douban](https://www.douban.com/people/91872582).
